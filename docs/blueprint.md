# **App Name**: DomainDarling

## Core Features:

- Domain Name Generation: Generates domain name suggestions based on user-provided application descriptions, using a Large Language Model as a tool.
- Domain Availability Check: Checks the availability of the .com domain for each suggested name using an external API.
- Display Available Names: Displays up to 5 available domain names at a time, showing whether .com domains are available. Names can be 'garbage' animated.
- Generate New Names: Allows the user to request another batch of 5 available names if they don't like the current suggestions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant purple (#A78BFA) for creativity and innovation.
- Background color: Light gray (#F4F5F7) to ensure a clean, modern interface that's easy on the eyes.
- Accent color: Teal (#4FD1C5) to draw attention to interactive elements like the 'Generate New Names' button.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a contemporary and clear heading style.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) to support readability in descriptions.
- Use custom-designed icons for domain categories (e.g., a lightbulb for innovative domains, a gear for tech domains) to enhance visual appeal.
- Implement a smooth, playful animation for when a domain name is 'garbaged,' such as a fading or sliding effect, to make the experience more engaging.
